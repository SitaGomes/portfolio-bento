I created this project to help me kick-start full stack projects with ease.

It is a CLI tool that generates a full stack project with Next.js for the frontend and Nest.js for the backend.

It is a community powered and open-source project. [![support button of obsidian bible reference](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Sponsor&message=%E2%9D%A4&logo=GitHub&color=%23fe8e86)](https://github.com/SitaGomes/create-kuma-project)
