Izacci is an Angolan fintech that seeks to simplify and make online payments more accessible, offering resources for managing recurring charges and punctual transactions with maximum security and convenience.
Focusing on providing owners and managers with a broader view of their revenues and financial health, Izacci assists in strategic decision-making through detailed reports and analysis.

To serve establishments such as stores, colleges and companies that want to modernize their collection processes,
Izacci provides an easy-to-use application capable of reducing operating costs and optimizing the receipt of payments.
In addition, the solution includes a control panel that allows institutions to generate electronic payment references for customers and track, in real time, the entire cycle of transactions, making the process more agile and secure.

I'm a co-founder and Izacci's CTO, responsible for the development of the product, infrastructure, strategy and the roadmap of the product.
